as two indicators. Across the 14.1.1a and 14.1.1b, two mandatory levels are proposed: Level 1: Global Data Products (globally available data from earth 
observations and modelling), Level 2: National Data, which are collected from countries (through the relevant Regional Seas Programme for countries that 
are member of a Regional Seas Programme, or directly by UNEP).</p>
